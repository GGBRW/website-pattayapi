    <h1>What we do</h1>

    <div class="left">
        <h2>Personal surveillance</h2>
        We have conducted surveillance for divorce proceedings, civil litigation, business disputes, worried parents and many more. Surveillance is always conducted by trained operators, so that we can gather intelligence without the subject of the investigation ever knowing. We will discuss your case with you to determine the best course of action; we recognize that everyone has different needs and requirements. Please contact us for a free consultation.
        <h2>Missing people</h2>
        We have successfully located people in and around Pattaya and other areas of Thailand. If you have lost a loved one in Thailand, we urge you to contact us as soon as possible for a free consultation. Time is almost always of the essence in such cases, don't wait and get in touch with us immediately.
        <h2>Social media analysis</h2>
        It is often the case that people in Thailand will use multiple social networking accounts to conceal their activities. Typically an individual in multiple relationships will use multiple Facebook accounts and multiple e-mail addresses to hide what they are doing. We are able to use forensic techniques to uncover digital footprints. We always recommend social media investigation as a starting point in infidelity investigations. We do not recommend this as a stand alone service as it can never be 100 percent guaranteed - if someone is taking extreme measures to conceal their activity online it may not be possible for any investigator to uncover this. We urge you to be very cautious of companies offering social media analysis, this can provide you with a false sense of security if not coupled with other surveillance work.

        <h2>Infidelity investigations</h2>
        Is she still working in the bar? Is she pregnant? Can we bar fine her? Is she offering massage with extras? Where is my husband? These are some of the many questions we have answered for our clients. We believe that you deserve peace of mind and we work tirelessly to unearth the truth for our clients. Our services are probably cheaper than you think and could save you more than just money in the long run. No-one deserves to be lied to, put us in your corner and discover the truth.
        <h2>Debt recovery in Thailand</h2>
        Are you owed money? PattayaPI will collect any size debt anywhere in Thailand with our unique debt recovery service. Without the right connections it can be very difficult encouraging people to make good on their debts. Let us step in and do all of the hard work recovering your money. Collecting debts in Thailand is not for the faint-hearted, we pursue every debt recovery case with an unrivaled tenacity and passion for justice. Get in touch with us today and see how we can help you.
        <h2>Thailand scammer investigation</h2>
        Unfortunately Thailand has a reputation of attracting tricksters and scammers, from simple timeshare scams or gold investment scams, to much more elaborate schemes. PattayaPI will investigate, track and monitor scammers in Thailand with the aim of bringing victims the justice and closure they deserve; preferably working together with your legal advisors at JaCogLaw. Please contact us for more information and we will be glad to offer advice on your situation.
